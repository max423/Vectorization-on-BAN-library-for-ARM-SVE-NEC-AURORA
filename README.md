# Vectorization-on-BAN-library-for-ARM-SVE-NEC-AURORA
In this project, we presented the acceleration of a C++ library for Bounded Algorithmic Numbers (BAN) by exploiting vector instructions. We also presented a non-Archimedean optimization benchmark with numerous iterations, used to evaluate the goodness of vector acceleration with respect to the BAN library.
